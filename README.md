# Juicing Tips

Speaking of which, juicing lemons and limes is super easy if you have an electric juicer, but even if you go unplugged like me, you can still squeeze a cup of lemon juice in less than five minutes. I like the old-fashioned kind, with the reamer built into a shallow bowl to catch the juice, but you can use one of those handheld wooden reamers if that's all you have. Also, this is a great job for kids!

I like my lemonade with the lemon pulp, but if you prefer it without, strain the lemon juice before mixing it with the simple syrup and water.

Do you make your own lemonade from scratch? How do you like it? What are your favorite variations?
A frosty glass of lemonade is a perfect way to keep cool and refreshed!
